### General Background

SmartSend is a B2B platfrom which prodvides innovative packages distribution solutions while relying on it's community - each individual is able to take an active role in SmartSend's system.  
With SmartSend's services we build a connection between retailers that want to deliver goods and producs, couriers who want to earn through delivering those products and costumers that want to free up time and effort to focus on whats more important in life.
SmartSend is an academic project (part of my degree's seminar) which was developed on course of ten months, presented in project's fair and scored a final grade of 95.

On the backend of our systems we gave a strong empahsis on cloud hosting and automatic data handling. With GCP & Firebase we were able to storage large-scale data, while given the option to modify and analyze it with ease. Moreover, Firebase services allowed us to authenticate users, dynamiclly save & delete new data and store logic functions on it's cloud.

Calculating delivery's price based on different parameters - distance from pickup point to destination, package size and delivery time.
Price is available to client on delivery setting screen and displayed to courier throughout the delivery.

#### Courier Matching Algorithm
SmartSend's system collects every courier location while using the app. When a new delivery request is recieved, the system searchs nearby couriers while increasing search's radius every iteration.
